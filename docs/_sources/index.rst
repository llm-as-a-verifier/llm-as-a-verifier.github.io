   :alt: LLM-as-a-Verifier overview

LLM-as-a-Verifier is a general-purpose framework that provides fine-grained feedback for any agent without requiring additional training. By leveraging the full distribution of scoring-token logits, our method captures evaluation uncertainty and enables verification to scale along three dimensions: score granularity, repeated evaluation, and criteria decomposition. The resulting fine-grained feedback can be used for test-time scaling, progress tracking, and reinforcement learning.
Its core features include:

- **Simple, Extensible API**: ``llm_verifier.select``, ``compare``, and ``track`` cover best-of-N selection, pairwise scoring, and progress tracking in a few lines.
- **Fine-Grained Rewards**: Continuous rewards in [0, 1] by scaling verification across multiple dimensions.
- **Cost-Efficient Best-of-N Selection**: The Probabilistic Pivot Tournament (PPT) ranks N candidate trajectories with O(Nk) pairwise verifications instead of a full O(N²) round-robin, concentrating the budget on uncertain top candidates.
- **Progress Tracking**: The same fine-grained reward scores a trajectory at every step — offline over a finished run or online while the agent is still executing.
- **Multimodal Inputs**: Every API supports optional image and video inputs, enabling the verifier to score images, VLM-based agents, and robotics rollouts.
- **State-of-the-Art Results**: Achieves SOTA on Terminal-Bench V2 (86.5%), SWE-Bench Verified (78.2%), RoboRewardBench (87.4%), and MedAgentBench (73.3%).
- **RL-Ready Dense Rewards**: Serves as a drop-in dense reward for reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency across both off-policy and on-policy RL.
